# models

*  The file model.safetensors contains neural network weights — the learned parameters of a model architecture.
* A model by itself is just the architecture and weights — it does not define how or when to act.
* Think of it as the "brain" that can process observations into embeddings or features, but not necessarily take actions yet.
